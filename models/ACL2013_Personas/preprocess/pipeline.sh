# Before running this script, you need to unzip (or move or symlink)
# several directories into this one.
#
# Step (1.1): get the CoreNLP plot summaries and unzip them here.
# http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/personas/data/corenlp_plot_summaries.tar
# You should have a 678 MB directory in here called
#   corenlp_plot_summaries/
#
# Step (1.2): get SupersenseTagger-10-01-12.tar.gz and unzip it in this directory.
# http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/mheilman/questions/SupersenseTagger-10-01-12.tar.gz
# You should have a 115 MB directory in here called
#   SupersenseTagger/
#
# Step (1.3): get the movie metadata files and unzip into this directory.
# http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/personas/data/MovieSummaries.tar.gz
# You should have a 128 MB directory in here called
#   MovieSummaries/

# After those steps, it should be possible to run this script
#   ./pipeline.sh
#

# This script runs each step in serial. After the JSON-ification, each pipeline step operates on one giant file.
# Commented-out is a parallelized version for the SST step (requires GNU Parallel)
# that's a bit faster if you have the cores/memory to spare.
#
# Note that individual steps can of course be run on any subset of the
# documents you want.  This is good for testing: for example, insert "head -5"
# (or whatever) into step (2) to only work on a few documents.
