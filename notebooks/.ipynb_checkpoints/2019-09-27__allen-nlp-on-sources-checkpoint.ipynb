    "doc = \"\"\"LEAD : For four and a half hours Wednesday , Dominick P. Pannunzio and 19 other guests in the burning Dupont Plaza Hotel lay sprawled on a 16th-story balcony , certain they were going to die . '' Everybody was crying , '' the 50-year-old lawyer from Pennsylvania said . I was crying myself . Mr. Pannunzio , who had come out of the shower nude when he heard a commotion in the hall and grabbed a sheet to cover himself , said he and his group fruitlessly screamed and waved to attract the attention of rescue workers . At the end , we were all just praying , '' said Betsy Sorber , 26 , who had flown to Puerto Rico with Mr. Pannunzio and five others on a gambling junket several days ago . Finally , she said , firefighters broke down the door of the smoke-filled hotel room and led them to the roof . ' What Is the Best Way to Die ? ' At that point , Mr. Pannunzio said , he had begun contemplating `` what was the best way to die , burning or jumping . Mr. Pannunzio , dressed today in a hospital worker 's green surgical room pants and new running shoes , said he thought of jumping off the balcony with a mattress to cushion his fall . But that was too crazy , '' he said . One man in the group tried climbing up the side of the building toward the roof , but he kept slipping and seemed in danger of plunging to the ground . Finally , Mr. Pannunzio said , the others talked him into huddling with them on the balcony , wet towels and wash cloths pressed to their noses to help them breath in the dense black smoke . Fifteen minutes before the fire broke out , Mr. Pannunzio said , he had been playing craps in the ground-floor casino , continuing a winning streak of more than $ 10,000 . He had gone up to his room , 1508 , to shower before going shopping with Miss Sorber . She was resting on the bed in slacks pulled over a one-piece bathing suit . Mr. Pannunzio bounded out of the shower , threw open the room door and saw clouds of gray smoke and running guests . Together , they plunged into a nightmarish fire exit stairwell , with people screaming , pushing , shoving , falling and being trampled . We ran down to the eighth floor , '' he recalled , `` and we ran into a solid wall of people yelling , ` Go up ! Go up ! You ca n't get through here ! ' You could n't see . Everyone was in a panic . ` People Were Gagging ' `` At the 17th or 18th floor , '' Mr. Pannunzio continued , `` a bunch of people were coming down yelling , ` Down ! down ! You ca n't go up ! ' We tried to get into one of the halls but all the doors were locked . People were gagging and falling down . I was getting woozy . Suddenly , he said , a hysterical maid threw open a door on the 16th floor and Mr. Pannunzio and about 20 others surged behind him . The maid had keys and let them into a room . They soaked the towels and linen , pressed them to their faces and shuffled to the balcony . People were crying and praying : ` Dear God , dear God , we 're going to die , ' '' he said . Several times a helicopter crew swung a seat on a rope toward them but no one could reach it , Mr. Pannunzio said . At one point , Mr. Pannunzio said , he thought of the film , `` The Towering Inferno , '' and of the fire at the M-G-M Grand Hotel in Las Vegas , Nev. , in 1980 . I thought , ` God , I 'm on my couch watching television and I 'm a part of this , ' '' he said . I thought , ` Any minute I 'm going to die . ' When the rescue team broke through , Miss Sorber recalled , she could see only a tiny flicker of light from the usually bright helmet lights the men wore . We all held hands , '' Miss Sorber said , `` and they led us out . We could n't see where we were going . Outside in fresh air , the group then had to scale a steel ladder that ran straight up the side of a wall leading to the roof , more than 20 stories above the street . One of Mr. Pannunzio 's friends from Pennsylvania broke a window in the casino with a chair and jumped two stories to the pavement . He broke a leg and severely cut one arm . Another member of the party , Mr. Pannunzio said , was still unaccounted for this afternoon .\"\"\""

The account - based mainly on admissions in recent weeks by at least one of the white teen-agers - places the pursuing whites closer to the spot where Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">Griffith</span> died and suggests that the 23-year-old black <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">man</span> had little choice but to go onto the <span style=\"background-color: rgba(106, 90, 205, 0.8)\">highway</span> .

Just West of Airport The new <span style=\"background-color: rgba(47, 79, 79, 0.8)\">account</span> , according to sources , does not alter the basic outline of the highly publicized case - that a group of 11 white youths attacked or tried to assault Mr. Griffith , Mr. Sandford and Timothy <span style=\"background-color: rgba(128, 128, 0, 0.8)\">Grimes</span> after the car the <span style=\"background-color: rgba(218, 112, 214, 0.8)\">blacks</span> were in broke down in the predominantly white <span style=\"background-color: rgba(250, 128, 114, 0.8)\">community</span> just west of Kennedy International Airport .

It is not clear whether any of the participants in the <span style=\"background-color: rgba(169, 169, 169, 0.8)\">attack</span> has been given immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony or whether Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">Sandiford</span> , who has been re-interviewed by Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(154, 205, 50, 0.8)\">Hynes</span> , has changed <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">his</span> original <span style=\"background-color: rgba(47, 79, 79, 0.8)\">account</span> . Charges Reduced When Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">Sandiford</span> did not appear at a hearing in Queens Criminal Court on Dec. 29 , Judge Ernest Bianchi said there was `` insufficient evidence '' to sustain Mr. Santucci 's preliminary charges against three defendants of murder , manslaughter and assault . The charges against the three - Jon L. Lester , 17 years old ; Jason Ladone , 16 , and Scott Kern , 17 - were reduced to reckless endangerment . All three had given statements regarding the beating of Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">Sandiford</span> , but none had admitted attacking Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">Griffith</span> .

Yesterday , investigators said that Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">Griffith</span> apparently brushed against a brown car , whose owner may have stopped briefly before leaving the scene , but that Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">Griffith</span> was still standing when <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">he</span> was hit by Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">Blum</span> . Among the questions raised by the new version , if true , is why Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">Sandiford</span> did not know that Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">Griffith</span> had turned off 156th Street a half-dozen blocks before Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">Sandiford</span> was attacked on the extension of that <span style=\"background-color: rgba(210, 105, 30, 0.8)\">street</span> and how Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">Sandiford</span> could have described Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">Griffith</span> 's movements at that point when <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">he</span> was no longer near Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">Griffith</span> . Indeed , the new <span style=\"background-color: rgba(47, 79, 79, 0.8)\">account</span> appears to suggest that Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.8)\">Griffith</span> was dead even before the <span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)\">whites</span> caught up with Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">Sandiford</span> .

The ethics bill - voted by 57 to 0 in the Senate and 142 to 1 in the Assembly - would require greater financial disclosure by legislators , their aides and all state officials in policy-making positions . It would restrict their appearances before state agencies on behalf of law clients and would establish panels with subpoena power to review conflict-of-interest and ethics complaints . The lone dissenting vote was cast by Assemblyman Robert J. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(188, 143, 143, 0.8)\">Connor</span> , a New City Democrat , who called the bill an `` overreaction to overblown media attention to ethics in government . The ethics vote by no means ended the feeling of siege here . Throughout the Capitol , aides to the Governor and Assembly Speaker Mel <span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.8)\">Miller</span> continued to spread nasty rumors about each other - part of the underside of what has become a high-stakes contest of wills between Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(144, 238, 144, 0.8)\">Cuomo</span> and the Legislature . Money for Commission Lawmakers have refused to allocate the  5 million Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(144, 238, 144, 0.8)\">Cuomo</span> wants for a commission <span style=\"background-color: rgba(144, 238, 144, 0.8)\">he</span> has named to investigate government ethics . In its place , they have suggested that the inquiry be conducted by the State Investigation Commission , the majority of whose members are named by the Legislature . So strong were the emotions that <span style=\"background-color: rgba(144, 238, 144, 0.8)\">Cuomo</span> aides privately accused the Speaker of having told reporters that the Governor opposed the State Investigation Commission because it had investigated his son <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">Andrew</span> . And aides to Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.8)\">Miller</span> , a Brooklyn Democrat , privately suggested that the Governor 's advisers had pressed television stations to run stories about the Speaker 's past connections as a lawyer for a company eventually implicated in New York City 's corruption scandals . Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(144, 238, 144, 0.8)\">Cuomo</span> not only held to his pledge that he would raise the  5 million for his commission from private sources if he had to , but even suggested he already had the source - `` a very wealthy guy whose name you 'd recognize immediately who called and said , ` Do n't worry about the  5 million . But even some members of the commission questioned whether it was legal to raise the money from private sources . ' Check With the Chairman ' Of the panel that the Legislature wants to conduct the inquiry , the State Investigation Commission , the Governor said , `` I do n't believe it wants this undertaking - all you need to do is check with the chairman . But when asked for comment , the chairman , David G. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.8)\">Trager</span> , released a statement by the full commission reaffirming earlier remarks in which it said it would be willing and well prepared to assume the undertaking . Lost amid the swell of accusations and resentment was the state budget , which was still not resolved today , seven days past the legal deadline for its adoption . The ethics bill voted today does not address recent payroll abuses laid in particular to the Senate Democrats , headed by State Senator Manfred <span style=\"background-color: rgba(127, 255, 212, 0.8)\">Ohrenstein</span> of Manhattan . Prosecutors say they are looking at whether several Democratic Senate candidates were provided campaign aides at government expense . However , the Legislature named a special commission today to look at such potential abuses and recommend guidelines . The three named were Carol <span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 239, 213, 0.8)\">Bellamy</span> , the former president of the New York City Council and a former state senator ; former Gov. Malcolm A. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 139, 0.8)\">Wilson</span> , and Robert B. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 0.8)\">McKay</span> , former dean of the New York University School of Law . Major Provisions Most of the major provisions of the ethics bill would take effect on Jan. 1 , 1989 , one day after the term of the current Legislature expires . The bill requires disclosure of outside salaries , gifts , loans and other compensation , as well as property and investment holdings - mostly in cases in which those items exceed  1,000 . The bill also requires disclosure by officials ' spouses and children under the age of 18 . But because of a recent revision , not all the information reported will be open to public scrutiny . Citizen-advocacy groups complained that while the bill limited officials ' appearances before state agencies , it did not completely rule them out . In addition , the bill does not limit appearances by law partners of an official - something earlier measures would have done . And it sets no conflict-of-interest restrictions on local officials of political parties . But lawmakers , clearly relieved at being able to claim they had passed an ethics bill , called it the most important measure of its kind here in more than a decade . Mr. <span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.8)\">Miller</span> , the Speaker , standing at the podium of Assembly chamber , signed the bill only seconds after its passage and dispatched an aide to rush it to the Governor . Get it out of here ! '' he said ."
