       "In Silicon Valley , Apple just won big against Samsung in the patent lawsuit of the year , after trading claims and counterclaims of pilfered product ideas .<br><br>Across the country , in a federal court in Florida , an inventor named Mark Stadnyk is waging a different kind of patent warfare — an ambitious and perhaps quixotic legal foray .<br><br>Mr. Stadnyk , who holds a patent on a motorcycle windshield , is suing the United States government , aiming to head off a patent law that he says will favor big companies and hurt lone inventors like himself .<br><br>Represented by a prominent Washington lawyer , Mr. Stadnyk filed a suit last month that challenges the constitutionality of legislation that Congress passed last fall , the America Invents Act .<br><br>Mr. Stadnyk and his lawyer — along with some academics , entrepreneurs and venture capitalists<br><br>— assert that the legislation is a triumph of corporate lobbying power over the founders ’ wishes , and that it threatens America ’s stature as the world ’s leading innovator .<br><br>The present system , one of the nation ’s oldest patent principles and called “ first to invent , ” relies on lab notebooks , e - mails and early prototypes to establish the date of invention .<br><br>The impending law would overturn that by awarding patents to the inventors who are “ first to file ” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office .<br><br>Mr. Stadnyk , 48 , a garage inventor who stumbled into the world of patents after he bought a powerful new motorcycle and wanted to avoid being battered by the wind when riding at 60 miles an hour , even with a windshield .<br><br>He devised a system of brackets and gears to adjust the height and angle of the windshield and the gap between it and the motorcycle .<br><br>With his system , he says , the rider feels a flutter of breeze instead of jolting winds and turbulence .<br><br>Mr. Stadnyk , who describes his invention style as “ rough hacking with chunks of metal , ” founded his company , MadStad Engineering , in 2006 , and as sales picked up , he stopped working as a computer consultant to devote himself to the business .<br><br>Today , MadStad employs eight people , including Mr. Stadnyk and his wife , Patty .<br><br>His adjustable windshield systems , priced from \\$ 100 to \\$ 320 , are now used on dozens of makes and models of motorcycles , and are sold through dealers in Australia , Britain and Spain , as well as the United States .<br><br>Yearly sales , he said , are more than \\$ 500,000 and growing briskly .<br><br>Mr. Stadnyk holds three patents , and he speaks of a patented idea as a uniquely human property right .<br><br>“<br><br>It came out of your mind , ” he explained .<br><br>“<br><br>It ’s not property you bought or inherited .<br><br>”<br><br>Mr. Stadnyk became interested in the patent legislation as it proceeded .<br><br>He says he studied the proposals and the law , read blogs and reached out to Washington lawyers and academics who raised the issue of its constitutionality .<br><br>A grass - roots activist , he even made a couple of YouTube videos .<br><br>The shift to a first - to - file system , scheduled to take effect next March , is intended to simplify and streamline the current system , which can invite protracted litigation between competing inventors .<br><br>The switch would also put the United States in harmony with patent offices in Europe , Japan and elsewhere , allowing them to share information and potentially ease the strain on overburdened patent examiners worldwide .<br><br>The efficiency argument is the mainstream view of corporate America and Washington policy makers .<br><br>President Obama declared that the new law would cut “ the red tape that stops too many inventors and entrepreneurs from quickly turning new ideas into thriving businesses — which holds our whole economy back .<br><br>”<br><br>But opponents say it will give big companies a huge advantage over start - ups and small inventors .<br><br>Large corporations have deep pockets and armies of lawyers to write up and file patents , they say , and the new law will touch off a paper chase to the patent office instead of a race to innovate .<br><br>Yet the opponents are in the minority .<br><br>And there is genuine debate about how much garage inventors and fledgling companies contribute to innovation and economic growth these days .<br><br>Mr. Stadnyk sees his courtroom quest as the intellectual property equivalent of the recent constitutional challenge to the Obama administration ’s health insurance overhaul , in legislation that was narrowly upheld by the Supreme Court .<br><br>“<br><br>Others took on Obamacare , and this is my fight , ” said Mr. Stadnyk , who lives in Ridge Manor ,<br><br>Fla. “<br><br>Somebody ’s got to do something .<br><br>” Mr. Stadnyk , who says he is a conservative , warns of the danger of the patent legislation in populist , antigovernment terms .<br><br>“<br><br>My property would be given away by the government under this new law , ” he said .<br><br>Yet there are liberals among the law ’s critics as well .<br><br>Mr. Stadnyk ’s Washington - based lawyer in the suit is Jonathan S. Massey .<br><br>A graduate of Harvard Law School , Mr. Massey was a clerk for the liberal Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. , and is a protégé of Laurence H. Tribe , a leading professor of constitutional law at Harvard .<br><br>Mr. Massey worked on the case presented to the Supreme Court on behalf of former Vice President Al Gore in Bush v. Gore , an appeal that lost and effectively settled the 2000 presidential election .<br><br>The America Invents Act was a byproduct of years of lobbying and eventual compromise , especially by major technology and pharmaceutical companies .<br><br>The new patent law was approved overwhelmingly in both the House and the Senate .<br><br>Few focused on the potential of a constitutional problem .<br><br>Senator Barbara Boxer , Democrat of California , was an exception .<br><br>Speaking on the Senate floor last year , she said , “ I strongly disagree with changing the core principle of our patent system — awarding a patent to the true inventor — for the sake of perceived administrative ease .<br><br>”<br><br>Ms. Boxer went on to say that the Constitution singles out and grants exclusive rights to individuals with new , useful ideas .<br><br>“<br><br>We are the only country in the world , ” she said , “ whose Constitution specifically mentions<br><br>‘ inventor .<br><br>’  <br><br>” Mr. Massey says he became involved in the legislative debate and this suit because of his background in constitutional law .<br><br>The new patent law , he said , “ violates the text and the original understanding of the Constitution .<br><br>”<br><br>In the suit , the government has until Thursday to reply .<br><br>Mr. Massey declined to say who would provide financial support if the case proceeded through appeals and higher courts .<br><br>As a matter of confidentiality and courtroom tactics , he said he did not want to let “ the other side know the size of my resources .<br><br>”<br><br>The suit , according to some legal experts , faces long odds .<br><br>The courts , they say , have treated the section of the Constitution that concerns intellectual property rights as utilitarian doctrine subject to Congressional interpretation .<br><br>“<br><br>Congress is fairly free to do as it sees fit to promote innovation , ” said Arti K.
