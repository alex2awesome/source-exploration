And so on Thursday, Houston, one of the finalists, is sending a lunch of barbecue, Blue Bell ice cream and pecan pie to the Democratic National Committee offices in Washington. On Friday, the politicians' menu is to be provided by Atlanta, another contender, and will include shrimp and peach pie.\",\n",

For example, George F. Will, the conservative commentator, wrote that Mr. Bush was behaving like ''a lapdog.''\",\n",

There are those who would forget the need for tolerance.''\",\n",
       " \"As an example of intolerance, Mr. Bush cited the efforts of some Christian fundamentalists to censor public school textbooks. ''There is no reason 'Huckleberry Finn' should be banned from the schools of this country,'' he said. ''There is no reason 'The Diary of Anne Frank' should not be read. To that small minority, I say, 'Please don't take away generally accepted books now that you have greater influence.' ''\",\n",

       " \"''You would wonder why it didn't happen before,'' said Charles M. Smith Jr., the City Buildings Commissioner, shortly after he inspected the accident site, on the ground floor of the Ansonia Hotel on Broadway, between 73d and 74th Streets, wearing a disposable jump suit to protect him from asbestos fibers found in the debris.\",\n",
       " \"Late yesterday, after conducting a preliminary review of renovation approved by his department dating back to the early 1980's, Mr. Smith said he would ask the Manhattan District Attorney to cooperate in a deeper investigation into whether the accident occurred as a result of criminal negligence.\",\n",
       " \"Mr. Smith said city officials who judged the renovation work in the past made only a cursory review of plans and did not inspect the construction work. Instead, because of the thousands of minor renovations each year, the department relied on the certification of licensed architects and engineers that the work was done safely and properly. #86-Year-Old Ceiling ''Occasionally architects and engineers make mistakes,'' he said.\",\n",
       " \"The collapse on Monday afternoon turned the Croissant & Company shop in the once-elegant Beaux-Arts hotel into a wasteland of twisted girders, pipes and 4,000 pounds of plaster from a decorative ceiling that was once part of the hotel's grand lobby.\",\n",
       " \"The ornate ceiling dated back to the building's construction in 1904. Mr. Smith said it was two inches thick in most places but had circular, flowerlike ornaments that were eight inches thick in spots.\",\n",
       " 'The plaster ceiling was supported by a network of railings and metal straps affixed to the steel beams that supported the concrete floor above.',\n",
       " 'After reviewing the wreckage, Mr. Smith said the plaster ceiling, in turn, supported a second ceiling - a lower, modern one -as well as air-conditioning ducts, drain pipes, water sprinkers and a canopy that hid some of the duct work above.',\n",
       " \"Mr. Smith said that holes drilled in the plaster over the years weakened it, and that a ''prudent architect and engineer'' would have realized that it could not support the weight of all the equipment installed below. Instead, he said, the plaster ceiling should have been removed.\",\n",
       " 'Wooden Beam',\n",
       " 'Building Department officials said yesterday that they had found plans for a 1981 renovation of the shop and were continuing to search for other records. The 1981 plans were filed by Paul J. Hanas Design Group of Westfield, N.J., and listed Walter J. Zupanchich as the architect of record.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Smith said the plans called for the attachment of the duct work to an existing wooden beam, while, in fact, no such beam existed on the site.',\n",
       " 'Asked about the plans yesterday, Mr. Zupanchich said he could not recall the details but that he would not as a rule hang duct work from a plaster ceiling and instead would affix it to structural elements, like a steel beam or a concrete floor.',\n",
       " 'He said any mistakes in construction would be the fault of the contractor, not the architect.',\n",
       " \"''In the span of nine years since then, I do not know what any new owner might have done to weaken the ceiling,'' he said.\",\n",
       " \"During the last few days a construction crew worked in the building's basement using a jackhammer on a concrete floor. A second crew cut a hole in the concrete slab above the croissant shop to install a drainpipe for new showers for a physical therapy studio being opened above the shop.\",\n",
       " 'Mr. Smith said that while either of these activities could have set off the collapse, the excessive weight appeared to have been the underlying cause.']"

       " \"ENVIRONMENTALISTS and county officials have often been at odds. At the moment they agree on one thing: the county's quality of life is increasingly at risk, and no one is minding the environmental store.\",\n",
       " \"''Land use, traffic patterns, water and air quality all add up to create quality of life,'' said Richard Knabel, vice president of the Federated Conservationists of Westchester County. ''But in the last 25 years, it has slipped. These days you can never count on getting anywhere within a particular time, water quality is deteriorating and all our open spaces are being eaten up. Pretty soon, people are going to wake up and say this isn't the place I remember, nor is it the place I want to be.''\",\n",
       " \"Elected leaders and their critics agree that the county's environmental concerns are urgent but there is disagreement among the officials about how to oversee the resolution. As a national Decade of the Environment begins, the county Board of Legislators and members of the County Executive's staff are trying to decide how to develop a countywide environmental presence and blaming each other for the lack of progress.\",\n",
       " 'A Stronger County Role',\n",
       " \"The goal is a stronger and more focused county role, to prevent further environmental deterioration and to protect critical open spaces like watershed land. ''The problem is not to create new legislation,'' said Robert Funicello, president of the Federated Conservationists, ''but to implement the broad array of laws already there.''\",\n",
       " 'He gave as an example the situation at Cranberry Lake, a pristine lake in North Castle owned by the county. It was the Federated Conservationists that told the county when an owner of 23 acres of adjacent land was ready to sell; and it is asking the county to purchase the land to protect the watershed. But Mr. Funicello suggested that the county should not need to be alerted by watchdog groups and should itself be taking the initiative.',\n",
       " \"Another example of how a stronger county role might make a difference is a $1 million federally financed study of surface-water pollution, done in 1975. It included proposals for eliminating pollution, but critics complain that the county has failed to implement them. Other action envisioned includes more attention to existing policies, like the county's highly respected open-space policy. Planners do not consistently follow it, Mr. Funicello suggested, and when they do, ''it's on an ad hoc or crisis basis, as with the Jay Property.''\",\n",
       " 'Legislators Await a Report',\n",
       " \"Last November, county legislators directed County Exeuctive Andrew P. O'Rourke to study the creation of a department of the environment to oversee Westchester's air, water and open spaces. A report is due May l. They first ignored and later rejected Mr. O'Rourke's request for a more modest office of the environment, which he had proposed as a first step.\",\n",
       " 'The legislators said they had eliminated the request in a difficult budget year, preferring to wait for the results of the report.',\n",
       " \"The idea for a new, consolidated department was proposed two years ago by the Pace University Law School's Center for Environmental Legal Studies, which prepared a report on behalf of the Federated Conservationists and submitted it to the county's Charter Revision Commission for review in May l988.\",\n",
       " \"The report, commissioned by Edith G. Read, a prominent environmental activist and a board member of the Federated Conservationists, sharply criticized the county's role in environmental protection. It outlined 20 years of what it saw as environmental neglect by county leaders and said this had resulted in a proliferation of hazardous-waste sites, polluted wells and increasingly unhealthful air.\",\n",
       " \"The report recommended streamlining county government to improve coordination and oversight of environmental programs. The authors called existing programs ''fragmented'' and ''inchoate,'' and suggested combining parts of seven programs that exist in several agencies into one new county department.\",\n",
       " 'Some Points Called Unfair',\n",
       " \"The report was written by Prof. Nicholas A. Robinson, co-director of the Center for Environmental Legal Studies at the Pace University Law School, and was entitled ''Enhancing Environmental Stewardship Goals for Westchester County Charter Revision.'' His conclusions stirred intense debate, and some members of the Board of Legislators called many of the criticisms unfair. After being lobbied by Mrs. Read and other conservationists, however, the Board voted unanimously to call for the special study.\",\n",
       " \"Although Mr. O'Rourke called the report a ''useful contribution'' to the Charter-revision effort, he urged the commission to reject the report's principal recommendation. ''The oversight aspect of environmental protection should not be mixed with responsibility for operating a facility,'' Mr. O'Rourke's letter to the Charter Revision Commission said, underlining his determination that the operators of environmental programs not be in the same department as those in charge of oversight.\",\n",
       " \"''Mr. O'Rourke does not want the chicken and the fox in the same department,'' said Marc Moran, director of intergovernmental relations.\",\n",
       " \"The commission agreed. ''If we created a Department of the Environment,'' said Dr. Sal J. Prezioso, chairman of the Charter Revision Commission, ''it would cost $1.25 million'' just to set it up. And what Dr. Prezioso called ''the turf question'' would also be difficult to resolve, he said. ''There isn't a single commissioner who would assist in giving up anything.''\",\n",
       " \"Not all environmentalists say the county needs such a department. Linda C. Cooper, who is chairwoman of the Yorktown Conservation Board, suggests that the county should develop a stronger environmental presence within the framework of existing departments. ''The county government does not take protection of the environment seriously, '' she said, but ''what the Westchester county government does not need is another layer of bureaucracy.''\",\n",
       " 'Other Ideas Win Support',\n",
       " \"The Charter Revision Commission recommended several of the ideas proposed in the Pace report, including a countywide storm-water agency, a countywide sewer district and ''an intermunicipal conflict resolution board.'' Dr. Prezioso said these steps were necessary before developing a countywide environmental policy and oversight department.\",\n",
       " 'Those suggestions are now being reviewed by different committees of the Board of Legislators.',\n",
       " \"Last March, when Mr. O'Rourke proposed an office of the environment instead of a department, he said it would allow him to address ''a responsibility of growing urgency.'' The task of protecting the environment ''threatens to overwhelm any individual operating department of this government,'' he said, because the departments ''do not and cannot possess the broad perspective'' necessary to make informed environmental decisions.\",\n",
       " \"The proposal languished in committee until the November election, and the new Board of Legislators rejected Mr. O'Rourke's request because ''we were tired of window-dressing,'' said Sandra R. Galef, the Democratic minority leader.\",\n",
       " \"''We didn't want to add another layer to the executive staff,'' she added.\",\n",
       " 'The Board Is Blamed',\n",
       " \"Mr. Moran said that because of the Board's action ''there isn't anyone to speak for the environment.''\",\n",
       " \"''We argued that one proposal didn't exclude the other,'' he said, explaining that funds were needed for an office of the environment to study the need for a new department of the environment. The executive staff had hoped to use the director of the new office to shepherd the study the Board requested.\",\n",
       " \"So work on the Board's request has been delayed, Mr. Moran said, adding: ''Are we running late? Sure we are.'' In the middle of what Mr. Moran called ''budget mania,'' the Board ''saw an easy way to cut $100,000,'' he said. Mr. O'Rourke had asked for $109,000 to set up an office of the environment.\",\n",
       " \"Although the executive branch will complete the study, Mr. Moran said, the Board's action has delayed the creation of environmental oversight. ''We have lost a year and we will have to go another year before any structure is in place,'' he said. ''Once this study is complete, the Board will hold public hearings, and that will take several more months.''\",\n",
       " \"What's Being Done Now\",\n",
       " \"County officials will continue to ''fill in the cracks,'' Mr. Moran said. ''The sky is not going to fall in.''\",\n",
       " \"Since November l987, an environmental work group that includes the deputy commissioners of five county departments has met monthly. It provides ''a way for the County Execucitve to get a seat-of-the-pants feeling about what is going on in the environment,'' Mr. Moran said.\",\n",
       " 'The group discusses such issues as pollution in Long Island Sound and a new permit for the Charles Point incineration plant, Mr. Moran said. It is also charged with considering environmental issues that cut across several departments or that affect only one department but could benefit from a broader perspective.',\n",
       " 'Impatience Grows',\n",
       " \"Environmental activists are increasingly impatient over the county government's failure to develop an environmental policy.\",\n",
       " \"''Westchester is taking its environmental stewardship for granted,'' Mr. Funicello said. ''We need a central focus in county government. Most environmental analysis is conducted by a commissioner who is not particularly sensitive to enviromental problems. There is not one person in government at present whose sensitivity to the environment is their first priority.''\",\n",
       " \"A department of the environment ''would create a critical mass on environmental issues'' and ''assure that the county acts right and is on the lookout for wrongs by others,'' he said.\",\n",
       " \"''The Federated Conservationists wouldn't disappear, for we know the values we espouse wouldn't be totally assimilated in a department of the environment,'' said its vice president, Mr. Knabel, who is a professor of physics at Westchester Community College in Valhalla. ''But now, it's as if we were chasing a blob of mercury across the floor. Mercury moves very quickly. And every time it meets an obstacle, it breaks up into little pieces, although it may re-emerge as a bigger piece later. That's just exactly how the county runs the environment.''\",\n",
       " \"Professor Robinson said his study ''showed how we have built duplicating and overlapping jurisdictions and how we haven't looked at environmental analysis in a comprehensive way.'' Some powers must be consolidated, he said, and added: ''Why should we wait for a worse degradation of the environment? The time has come to act.''\",\n",
